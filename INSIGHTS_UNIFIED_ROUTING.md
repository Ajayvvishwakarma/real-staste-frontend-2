# Insights Dropdown Unified Routing Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented unified routing for all insights dropdown options to open the same `UnderstandLocalities.jsx` component.

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Target Achievement**
All 4 insights dropdown options now route to the same page:
- ✅ **Understand localities** → `/insights/understand-localities`
- ✅ **Read Resident Reviews** → `/insights/understand-localities` (changed from `/resident-reviews`)
- ✅ **Check Price Trends** → `/insights/understand-localities` (changed from `/insights/price-trends`)
- ✅ **Tools, Utilities & more** → `/insights/understand-localities` (changed from `/insights/tools-utilities`)

### 📁 **Files Modified**
- **`src/Components/Navbar.jsx`**: Updated 3 instances of the insights dropdown configuration
