### Backend Guide

Complete backend implementation guide provided in `BACKEND_CAMPAIGN_API_GUIDE.md`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Setup Environment Variables

Create or update `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\bhoomi-realestatefrontend\bhoomi-realestatefrontend\99acres'
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Setup Backend (if not already done)

Follow the instructions in `BACKEND_CAMPAIGN_API_GUIDE.md` to:
1. Create the backend server
2. Setup MongoDB
3. Create the Campaign model
4. Implement API routes
5. Start the backend server

### Step 4: Test the Features

1. Login to your dashboard
2. Click on "E-Mailers" in the sidebar

#### B. Create New Campaign

   - **Email Content**: Write your email content
   - **Recipient List**: Add email addresses (one per line)
     ```
     user1@example.com
     user2@example.com

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to create campaign"
**Solution**: Check that:
1. Backend server is running on port 8000
2. MongoDB is connected
3. You're logged in (token exists in localStorage)
4. CORS is configured correctly on backend

### Issue: Campaigns not loading
**Solution**: 
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for error messages
3. Verify API_URL in .env file
4. Check backend logs for errors
5. The app will show mock data as fallback if backend is unavailable

### Issue: Form not submitting
**Solution**:
1. Check all required fields are filled
2. Email addresses should be valid
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify network tab for API calls
